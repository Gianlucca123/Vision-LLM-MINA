# VLM Testing

This repository provides scripts to test various VLM models. Each model has a corresponding script that must be executed to test the model.

## Each model will be tested as follows : 
`Img1.jpg` will be fed to the model, who will be asked to `Describe this image.`.
The resulting answer will be printed in the terminal.

## Notes
Feel free to make changes and test on your own !
